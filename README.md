Folder contains codes for Low Rank Phase Retrieval. Originally written by Seyedehsara Nayer, modified by PN. Update to be done will be done soon

This contains the codes accompanying the paper
[1] Phaseless Low-Rank Matrix Recovery and Subspace Tracking, Seyedehsara Nayer, Praneeth narayanamurthy, Namrata Vaswani, ICML 2019.

The following are the list of files:

1. 
2. compare_video.m contains the demo file for running the phase retrieval algorithms for a real video.



%%%%%%%things to do 

1. rewrite the variable names, they are extremely confusing, and also don't make much sense
2. delete the useless codes
	2.1 find out what are the final codes that are used in the paper
	2.2 modify the structure

3. there are too many lines that are commented, 

4. the comments mostly come from the fact that in many scripts, we run each algorithm, comment it, and then run other algorithms. Not sure how to fix this, but one way is to include codes that only implement our algorithm. 

5. Add a code that computes the "matrix distance"

6. There should be a better way to write the parameters part of the code.

7.
